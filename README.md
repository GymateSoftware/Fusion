## Introduction

**Luna** is a dynamically-typed, interpreted server scripting language designed to be as simple as possible to use while
providing
all the common tools a network professional would need.

## Why?

**Luna** was developed here at Gymate for use on our backend servers. Shell scripts are combersome
and environment dependent and Python/Ruby/Lua offer too much out of the box for simple system scripting. Luna intends to
fill that gap and provide network and system professionals with the best tool for the job.
